## Python-Hypothesis-Testing

**Description**:

In this Python project, I conducted hypothesis testing on a US healthcare insurance dataset obtained from Kaggle. The objective of this project is to gain insights into various aspects of the dataset through statistical analyses, utilizing libraries such as Scipy and Statsmodels. The key steps in the project include:

1. **Data Exploration**: Loaded and explored the healthcare insurance dataset to understand its structure and key variables.
2. **Formulation of Hypotheses**: Defined hypotheses to be tested based on specific aspects of the dataset, such as the impact of certain variables on insurance premiums or the significance of demographic factors.
3. **Hypothesis Testing Implementation**: Utilized statistical tests from Scipy and Statsmodels to test the formulated hypotheses rigorously.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Performed a comprehensive statistical analysis to assess the significance of relationships and draw meaningful conclusions.
5. **Results Interpretation**: Interpreted the results of the hypothesis tests, providing insights into the dataset's underlying patterns and relationships.
